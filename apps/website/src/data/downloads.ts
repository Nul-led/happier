/**
 * Single source of truth for every download URL and install command on the site.
 *
 * This file exists because three separate surfaces were each hand-typing URLs
 * and three of them were dead on 2026-08-08:
 *
 *   - DownloadBadges linked Google Play at `id=dev.happier`. That listing has
 *     never existed (HTTP 404). The real package id is `dev.happier.app`,
 *     which spent months as a closed testing track reachable only through the
 *     opt-in URL below, and is now the public listing in ANDROID_PLAY_URL.
 *   - DownloadBadges once pinned desktop URLs to v0.2.0. Rolling releases now
 *     publish stable aliases specifically so public links never need a version bump.
 *
 * Anything that points off this site belongs here, and `yarn check:links`
 * (scripts/check-download-links.mjs) HEADs every one of them before a deploy.
