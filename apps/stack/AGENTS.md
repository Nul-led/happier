# Happier Stack Instructions

Package-specific instructions for `apps/stack` (`@happier-dev/stack`). These supplement the root constitution and override broader guidance where more specific.

## Ownership

`@happier-dev/stack` provides local stack/worktree/dev orchestration for the Happier monorepo.

- `scripts/*.mjs` — setup/bootstrap, run/dev/build, stacks, worktrees, service, tailscale, mobile, tools.
- Default home: `~/.happier-stack`.
- Default workspace: `~/.happier-stack/workspace`.
- Main checkout: `<workspace>/main` (stable launcher/default state).
- Dev checkout/worktrees: `<workspace>/dev`, `<workspace>/pr/**`, `<workspace>/local/**`, `<workspace>/tmp/**`.
- Stack storage: `~/.happier/stacks/<stack>/**`.

## Command discipline

Use `hstack` for stack-managed workflows:

- `hstack start` / `hstack dev`
- `hstack typecheck` / `hstack lint` / `hstack test` / `hstack build`
- `hstack stack ...`
- `hstack wt ...`
- `hstack tailscale ...` / `hstack service ...`
- `hstack tools ...` for maintained stack tools

Do not run stack-scoped commands directly inside monorepo checkouts when a stack command exists (`yarn dev`, `yarn start`, raw `expo`, raw `tsc`/`eslint`, raw `docker compose`, raw `git worktree`). If a low-level command is needed repeatedly, prefer adding or using a stack command.

## Worktrees

- Do not develop directly in `<workspace>/main`; treat it as stable launcher state.
- Make changes in `<workspace>/dev`, `<workspace>/pr/**`, `<workspace>/local/**`, or `<workspace>/tmp/**`.
- Use `hstack wt ...` for worktree operations.
- Do not switch branches in the primary checkout.

Common commands:

```bash
hstack wt new pr/my-feature --from=upstream --use
hstack wt pr 123 --use
hstack wt use pr/123-fix-thing
hstack wt list
hstack wt status
```

## Stacks

Do not create a dedicated stack merely because testing or QA involves stack services. When a human explicitly requests a dedicated, isolated, stable, controlled, snapshot-backed, or manual-restart QA stack, invoke `.agents/skills/happier-controlled-stack-qa`; that skill owns creation, session-wide reuse of one remembered stack, runtime selection, reload boundaries, borrowed Expo, and teardown. Additional or replacement stacks require an explicit human request.

When a human has already authorized or named a stack, use that exact stack for the session rather than creating a replacement because its identity was forgotten.

Prefer stack env files and `hstack stack env ...` over hand-editing `env.local`.

Keep the default `main` stack stable and do not commandeer a human-owned development stack or another agent's mutable QA stack.

## Repo-local development database reconciliation

- The deterministic `repo-<checkout>-<id>` stack resolved from the current checkout is its repo-local development stack. Resolve it from current stack metadata and verify its `repo.dir` matches the current checkout; never guess from a similar stack name or mutate every stack that references the checkout.
- Its managed database contains retained development data and is not disposable. Never delete, reset, recreate, replace, truncate, clean, or discard it to fix migration drift.
- When an agent edits a local-only/development-exposed migration already applied to that database, the same task automatically owns in-place reconciliation and canonical migration deployment. No separate confirmation or backup/snapshot/clone is required for this one target.
- If its writers are running, quiesce only stack-owned processes through `hstack`, record whether the stack was running, reconcile, and restore the prior running state. Never kill by port or stop another stack.
- Locate the live database from the stack's current runtime placement (`dev-targets.json` `runtimePlacement.server`, then that target's stack-state `server-light` data dir), not from the local default path; a placed server uses the target's database, and other copies are not authoritative.
- Reconcile to the canonical schema, never to the ledger alone:
  1. Build a scratch database by running the canonical deploy (`migrate:sqlite:deploy` with a temporary `HAPPIER_SERVER_LIGHT_DATA_DIR`) from the current migration set.
  2. Compare scratch and live semantically: tables, columns (type, nullability, default), foreign keys, indexes, CHECK constraints and triggers. Text differences in stored SQL alone are not drift. Tables created at runtime rather than by migrations are not drift.
  3. Apply the exact delta in one transaction. SQLite constraint or type changes need a table rebuild that copies rows and asserts row counts. Any data conversion (a renamed or retyped column holding data) is defined by the migration's editing owner; never invent one.
  4. Update only the affected ledger rows, inside the same transaction, after the schema matches.
- Before handoff, run the canonical deploy twice, verify every current migration checksum against the ledger, rerun the semantic comparison (it must be clean), and run provider integrity/foreign-key checks. A later migration edit invalidates that evidence and makes the later editor responsible for reconciliation again.
- Fail closed for ambiguous identity, `main`, shared, staging, production, external, another checkout's/named QA stack, or otherwise user-owned databases; their normal approval and backup requirements remain in force.

## Safety invariants

Preserve these unless the task explicitly redesigns stack behavior:

- Never kill by port in stack mode.
- Stack stop/restart kills only stack-owned processes recorded in runtime state or stack markers.
- Non-main stacks pick ports at start time; runtime ports are recorded in `stack.runtime.json`.
- `--restart` should reuse previous runtime ports or fail closed if occupied.
- Watcher restarts must be stack-owned and PID-verified.
- Do not auto-enable/repoint Tailscale Serve for non-main stacks by default.
- Multiple daemons are expected across stacks; never fix stack issues by killing all daemons.

## Auth and secrets

- Configure a seed stack once, commonly `dev-auth`.
- New stacks can reuse auth with `hstack stack auth <name> copy-from dev-auth`.
- If the seed is unknown, fall back to copying from `main` only when appropriate for the local setup.

## Testing

- Keep stack tests on native `node --test`; do not migrate stack tests to Vitest or Playwright.
- Unit tests use `*.test.mjs`.
- Integration tests use `*.integration.test.mjs` and remain serial.
- Real integration tests use `*.real.integration.test.mjs`, remain serial, and require `HAPPIER_STACK_RUN_REAL_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`.
- Canonical runner/discovery helpers live under `scripts/utils/test/**`.
- Canonical stack-local testkit primitives live under `scripts/testkit/core/**`.
- Prefer existing helpers over ad hoc tempdir/env/spawn wrappers.

Validation lanes:

```bash
yarn --cwd apps/stack test:unit
yarn --cwd apps/stack test:integration
```

If `yarn` is not on PATH, use `corepack yarn ...`.
