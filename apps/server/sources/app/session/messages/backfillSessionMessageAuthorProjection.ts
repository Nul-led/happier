 * One-time, provider-neutral, idempotent population of the derived
 * `SessionMessage.authorAccountId` query projection.
 *
 * It keyset-pages rows by primary key, parses each stored receipt
 * with the canonical Protocol parser, and fills only a still-null projection
 * from an exact valid authenticated-Account receipt whose Account still exists.
 * Machine, absent, malformed, unknown-version, non-user, and deleted-Account
 * rows are deliberately left null: missing evidence cannot be reconstructed
 * from Session ownership, content, timestamps, or descriptive provenance.
 *
 * A pre-existing non-null row that disagrees with its receipt is reported and
 * fails the run rather than being "repaired" in either direction; the receipt
 * bytes are never rewritten.
 *
 * No checkpoint, queue, or worker is needed: an interrupted scan safely
 * restarts, and deployment runs this once after the current-writer cutover (and
 * again after a supported interrupted upgrade) before Lane 09 activates its
 * author-based personal scopes.
