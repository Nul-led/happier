/**
 * The released direct-share socket events, projected from committed access state.
 *
 * These three events are a compatibility hint for clients that predate the
 * effective-access projection. They are derived here from the canonical before/after
 * result rather than from "a row was written", because a released client treats
 * `session-share-revoked` as deleting the whole Session locally. Emitting one because
 * a direct row disappeared, while a Team or Group grant still admits the reader,
 * would destroy a still-authorized client's local state.
 *
 * Two rules follow from the released payloads themselves and are load-bearing:
 * every event needs a real `SessionShare.id`, and no event may claim authority the
 * direct row does not carry. A pure Team/Group grant or membership change therefore
 * emits nothing and converges through AccountChange plus the current projection.
