/**
 * Installed terminal producers consumed by the server usage writer.
 *
 * Ordinary Session observations enter through the Agent runtime Session-turn
 * route. The writer resolves their immutable turn witness before recording Team
 * attribution, so broker admission remains request-count-only and cannot
 * duplicate the terminal token fact.
 *
 * The ordinary Session producer is also consumed by an attached
 * Session-derived Execution Run. Two paths remain explicit fail-closed entries,
 * each for its own exact reason:
 *
 * - `agent_runtime_detached_execution_run`: a detached Run has no Happier
 *   Session, so it has no Agent usage publisher, and the Agent Run runtime
 *   contract deliberately keeps usage outside the finite Run event union
 *   (`packages/plugin-sdk/src/agentRuntime/executionRun.ts`). No provider
 *   observation reaches the host at all, so nothing can be attributed.
 * - `external_provider_terminal`: the broker now observes the admitted public
 *   response once and reports the Provider's own terminal tokens, but the
 *   OpenAI Chat Completions route emits `usage` in a stream only when the
 *   caller sends `stream_options.include_usage`, which this broker does not add
 *   to a caller's request
 *   (`apps/cli/src/providers/broker/externalProviderTerminalTokens.ts`). One
 *   route mode that can legitimately report nothing is enough to make a
 *   resource-wide token ceiling dishonest, so the row stays closed while the
 *   per-request `measurement` stays truthful.
 *
 * The resource test is a bounded probe, not inference: it never draws on a
 * token or cost ceiling, so it neither proves nor withholds one.
 * Claude and Codex have Agent-local pricing estimators, but their runtime
 * owners deliberately withhold those estimates for arbitrary Provider-bound
 * models. They therefore do not establish complete exact price coverage for a
 * Team resource's model/protocol set.
