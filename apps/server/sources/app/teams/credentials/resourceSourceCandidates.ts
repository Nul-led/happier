 * A Provider connection lives in the owner's Account Settings, which the Home
 * stores opaquely and may not read at all when the Account is end-to-end
 * encrypted. Home therefore cannot enumerate it or produce its security
 * fingerprint. The authenticated custodian client may compose those candidates
 * from its canonical local Provider registry and return the selected strict
 * binding through create; `supportedKinds` advertises that consumed path, not
 * Home-side Provider authority.
 *
 * Connected Accounts are projected by their canonical repository, which pairs
 * safe current presentation with the immutable credential-row lifetime. This
 * adapter never parses stored credential metadata or invents a label from the
 * qualified routing identity.

 * Every source the authenticated Account may offer to one Team, each carrying
 * the exact lifetime a resource would pin.
 *
 * The pin is the point. A resource stores the owning credential row for an
 * Account and the persisted incarnation for a Pool so that deleting and
 * recreating either one does not silently retarget the Team's resource at
 * different upstream material. Neither identity appears in the Connected Account
 * read projections a client holds, so a client assembling its own binding would
 * have to invent or omit the pin — which is how a stale choice becomes a
 * successful offer. The Home reads both here, beside the offer decision it
 * already owns, and the chooser sends the binding back unchanged.
 *
 * Nothing about the credential itself crosses this boundary: no token, expiry,
 * refresh lease, configuration or scope. Every row is already this Account's
 * own, because only a source's custodian may offer it.
