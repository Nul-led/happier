 * This is deliberately not a Home capability and must never be combined with

 * not a Home owner, and folding it into Home authority would silently grant
 * Account deletion and Team governance. It is kept only so existing
 * deployments keep working, and it is removed once the supported operator
 * migration to a persisted Home role is established. It now additionally
 * requires the listed Account to be active, because an offboarded Account must
 * not keep reading server diagnostics.
