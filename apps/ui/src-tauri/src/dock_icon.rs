//! Running-app Dock icon on macOS.
//!
//! Since macOS 26 every bundled app icon is drawn on the system's square tile,
//! so the notch in Happier's mark shows the tile colour instead of the Dock
//! behind it. An image set at runtime through
//! `NSApplication.applicationIconImage` is drawn as-is, which keeps the notch
//! transparent while the app runs. Tauri already does this for dev builds only
//! (`#[cfg(dev)]` in tauri's `app.rs`); this applies the same artwork in every
//! build.
//!
//! Finder, Launchpad and the Dock before launch still show the bundled
//! `icons/AppIcon.icon`; only the running app's Dock tile changes.

/// Same artwork Tauri's dev Dock icon uses: the mark on a transparent canvas.
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
const DOCK_ICON_PNG: &[u8] = include_bytes!("../icons/icon.png");

/// Must run on the main thread (Tauri's `setup` hook does).
