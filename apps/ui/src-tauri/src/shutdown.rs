//! Desktop quit handoff.
//!
//! The main window never closes — it hides to the tray (`window_chrome::resolve_desktop_window_close_strategy`)
//! — so "the app closed" is the app exiting, and that happens exactly once, never once per window.
//! It is where the background-service preference is honoured, and the webview owns the decision
//! because only it knows what is running on this computer and can put a question to the user.
//!
//! The safe direction is asymmetric: leaving the daemon running costs the user nothing they did
//! not already have, while stopping it can end in-flight agent work. So the exit proceeds unless
//! the webview asks for the handoff, and the service is only ever stopped by the webview acting on
//! an answer it actually received. A force quit, an OS shutdown or a logout that kills the app
//! part-way through therefore leaves the daemon exactly where it was.
//!
//! R16 (a): with the login-start setting on, the webview answers the handoff with `menuBar`
//! instead of exiting — the app then drops its windows and web UI and keeps only the tray
//! (`crate::menu_bar`), with the services still running. Destroying the last window raises an
//! implicit exit request, which menu-bar mode holds; only an explicit Quit ends that process.
