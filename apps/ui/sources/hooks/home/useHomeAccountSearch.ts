 * Keeping the refusal matters: a Home that has no such operation must be
 * explained as an older Home rather than shown as "no matches", which would be
 * a false answer about who is on it.
 *
 * The shared hook caches by query for its component's lifetime, so a surface
 * that can change Home or Account underneath it must remount this hook — see
 * the People screen, which keys its search section by scope.
