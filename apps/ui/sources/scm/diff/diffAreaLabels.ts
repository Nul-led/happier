 * The words for a diff area. They follow what the areas are, not the backend: with an index (Git
 * staging) they are Unstaged / Staged / Both; with Happier's own commit selection (the atomic
 * strategy) they stay Pending / Included / Combined. The file header and Review's area choice both
 * read them here, so a file never says "Staged" while Review says "Included" for the same thing.
