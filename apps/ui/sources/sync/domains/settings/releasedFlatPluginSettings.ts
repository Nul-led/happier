/**
 * Released Happier persisted plugin-declared **Account-scoped** settings as flat
 * root keys on the Account Settings document (`settings.codexBackendMode`). The
 * current owner of those values is the scoped plugin-settings record, and the
 * Account Settings parser keeps an unrecognized released root key as an opaque
 * forward-compatible value, so an upgraded Account still carries the choice the
 * user actually made.
 *
 * This module is the single owner of the question "may this released root key
 * supply a declared Account-scoped field?". Both readers that can answer with a
 * value — the declared-field reader that applies declaration defaults, and the
 * Agent UI setting reference reader — consume it, so neither can start
 * admitting a carrier the other refuses.
 *
 * A key that current host Settings own is never borrowed. Without that guard an
 * Agent could read unrelated Account Settings simply by naming a declared field
 * after one of them.
