/**
 * May a person choose this run as the destination of their next message?
 *
 * This answers **addressability**, not interaction capability. It runs on
 * transcript-derived roster facts — the only evidence a Session roster has — and
 * a positive answer means the composer may target the run so canonical Session
 * input admission can durably queue the input against it. Admission then owns
 * what actually happens: an unproven or unloaded target stays visibly queued, and
 * a positively terminal or noninteractive target moves through the blocked
 * Pending lifecycle. Nothing here reaches a runtime.
 *
 * What this must never do is authorize a mutation control. Whether a run can
 * accept a turn, be steered, be cancelled or be resumed is owned solely by
 * `resolveExecutionRunInteractionAffordances`, which reads the daemon's exact
 * `interaction` projection for a live retained controller. Voice keeps its own
 * dedicated surface and is not addressable from a Session composer.
