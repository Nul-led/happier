/**
 * The narrow `happier/machine/1` opener the existing machine-carrier seam
 * consumes (Lane 06 A7.4).
 *
 * `machineCarrierBrowserStream` owns machine admission: it mints the signed
 * handshake through the one canonical mint owner, writes the canonical frame,
 * and reads the single admission decision byte. It needs exactly two things
 * from the browser endpoint — an endpoint lease whose EndpointId is the
 * initiator's transport identity, and a raw machine/1 duplex to the exact
 * signed target. This module is that adapter and nothing more.
 *
 * It supplies no local origin and no `runtimeOrigin`: a browser cannot bind
 * one, and none is fabricated. It interprets no ALPN string either — the
 * requested protocol is the closed `'machine'` stream kind, which the endpoint
 * owner routes to the generated machine operation, which applies the shared
 * core's `MACHINE_ALPN`.
 *
 * The canonical transfer route owner consumes this binding through
 * `acquireBrowserMachineCarrierHttpLease`, once a browser host and a target
 * descriptor make the Iroh route eligible.
