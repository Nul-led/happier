/**
 * Which Home a public `/teams/:teamId/sign-in` link addresses.
 *
 * The Team page is scoped entry into one exact Home, so the Home must come from
 * the link rather than from whichever Home this device happens to have focused.
 * Child 02 §7.1 is explicit that "a device-local `ServerProfile.id` query value
 * is not a portable Home address": a profile id is local routing storage that
 * differs per device, so a link carrying one is unusable on the phone the person
 * actually opens it on.
 *
 * The portable carrier is therefore resolved through the same owner the join
 * link uses — there is one explicit-target carrier and one resolver for it, not
 * an invitation copy and a sign-in copy. The device-local `serverId` remains
 * accepted because in-app navigation and the OAuth `returnTo` still address the
 * already-adopted Home that way; it is a same-device convenience, never the
 * portable form.
 *
 * A Home this device has not adopted is not a failure. Unlike a join link, a
 * Team sign-in URL carries no bearer, so nothing secret is at stake — but the
 * entry projection still has to be requested from a Home whose identity this
 * build can verify, and adopting one is the existing Homes acquisition flow.
 * A member sign-in link carries that Home's full descriptor exactly as an
 * invitation does, so this consumes the same acquisition lifecycle the join
 * screen does rather than discarding the descriptor and asking the person to
 * find the Home by hand.
