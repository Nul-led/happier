/**
 * The one owner of the Run's completion moment.
 *
 * Haptics and the visible emphasis are decided here together, so a native
 * device can never buzz for something that produced nothing on screen. The
 * moment is keyed to the state transition this mounted instance actually
 * observed — not to a refresh, a remount or a transport label — so re-entering
 * a finished Run replays nothing and no "already played" flag has to be
 * persisted.
 *
 * The observation belongs to one Run. The detail screen stays mounted across a
 * Run change, so without `identity` the previous Run's `running` was compared
 * against the next Run's already-`completed` state and celebrated a completion
 * this instance never watched happen.
 *
 * Under reduced motion the emphasis never appears: the authoritative status
 * change is applied immediately and is itself the visible twin of the haptic.
