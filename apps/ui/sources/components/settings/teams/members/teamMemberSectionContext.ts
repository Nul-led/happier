/**
 * The contract a contributed member-detail section receives.
 *
 * This is the mount contract for sections owned outside this child — Lane 06's
 * recipient key preparation is the first — so a contributor does not resolve its
 * own Home, Account, Team or membership and cannot end up addressing a different
 * one than the screen the person is looking at.
 *
 * `mutationsAvailable` is the host's single decision about whether a write may be
 * offered at all: it is false while the Team projection is stale or its Home is
 * unreachable, and while the Team is archived. A contributed section consumes it
 * rather than re-deriving readiness, so one screen cannot offer a live control in
 * one section and a disabled one in another.
