/**
 * The one governance notice for a Team left without an active owner.
 *
 * `recovery.kind === 'owner_required'` is the Home's own condition, published on the Team
 * projection, so no surface counts owners for itself. The notice is a statement
 * of that condition and is therefore shown to every viewer the Home answers;
 * who may begin recovery stays with `recovery.canAppointOwner`. The roster's
 * per-membership `setRole` capability independently decides which existing
 * member is an eligible candidate; neither projection stands in for the other.
 *
 * It deliberately promises nothing about content: a Home administrator
 * restoring an owner gains no access to the Team's sessions, and the copy says
 * only what the Team needs.
 *
 * The notice lives in one component and mounts on both the Team overview and
 * the roster: the overview routes to the roster where candidates actually are,
 * and the roster explains, once it has read the whole sequence, when there is
 * no eligible candidate at all.
