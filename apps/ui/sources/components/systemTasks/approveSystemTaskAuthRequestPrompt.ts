 * secret, claim material, or state path is ever placed in the answer, and every refusal is
 * answered so the task fails by name instead of waiting for a timeout.
 *
 * The relay check is a **hard refusal settled before** anything else: a prompt whose Home is not
 * the one the caller is setting up is never approved, and never reachable through a dialog.
 *
 * Only then does install ownership decide *how* the pairing is approved. That ownership is a
 * record, not verified publisher provenance — `managed` means this machine's managed release path
 * installed the binary, derived from a plain text marker under the user's own home — so it says
 * "this app's install path put it there", never "this binary is cryptographically official":
 *
 *   - **managed** — approve silently, so ordinary first-run onboarding stays zero-interaction.
 *   - **anything else, including a prompt that names no provenance** — ask the human exactly once,
 *     naming the resolved command. Accepting approves; declining refuses by name.
 *
 * Asking is what makes a repo/override build usable at all: refusing outright left every
 * developer and fork with a failure whose only affordance was a Retry that failed identically.
 * The narrower invariant this preserves is that the app must not release account authority
 * **unattended** to a CLI its own install path did not place.
