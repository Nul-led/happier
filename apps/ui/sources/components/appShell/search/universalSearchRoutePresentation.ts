/**
 * How the canonical `/search` route is presented.
 *
 * Native renders universal Search as a transparent full-screen overlay: results scroll above a
 * search plane seated over the software keyboard while the screen the user came from stays visible
 * behind the scrim. `transparentModal` (`UIModalPresentationOverFullScreen`) is one of the two
 * presentations for which `@react-navigation/native-stack` omits its opaque `contentStyle`
 * background — the precondition for the route painting its own ground — and, unlike the contained
 * variant, it is top-level, so popover anchoring inside the overlay keeps window coordinates
 * authoritative.
 *
 * Web/desktop keep the ordinary router presentation: the shortcut and sidebar open the modal in
 * place, and `/search` remains a direct deep-linkable screen rendering the same controller.
