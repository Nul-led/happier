 * Live composer text for one new-session screen instance: the shared composer text store.
 *
 * The new-session screen model is a large hook tree (~1,900 lines, ~36 memos across its
 * sub-hooks). While the prompt was `React.useState` inside that tree, every keystroke
 * re-executed the whole model, rebuilt the authoring draft and authoring context, and
 * invalidated both screen-variant prop bundles. The composer input subscribes with
 * `useNewSessionPromptValue`; submit, send and draft persistence read `getPrompt()`.
 * These names are New Session's vocabulary for the one implementation in `composerTextStore`.
