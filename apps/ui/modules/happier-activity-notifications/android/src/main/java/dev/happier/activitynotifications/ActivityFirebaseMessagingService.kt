/**
 * The single Firebase messaging entry point for this app.
 *
 * It runs in the isolated `:happier_activity_notifications` process so a closed
 * app can present an Activity remote alert without starting the app runtime. It
 * is not a second sender: exactly one path handles each message.
 *
 * - A recognized Activity remote alert is offered to an already-loaded app
 *   process so its foreground/privacy handler remains authoritative, otherwise
 *   it is presented here through the same presenter after exact-Home admission.
 * - The Home's content-free `session_changed` wake is offered to the app
 *   process only, because the `remote-notification` task-manager registry and
 *   the React host that owns the wake consumer are per-process and this process
 *   deliberately has neither. A wake that arrives while the app process is not
 *   loaded is dropped rather than presented: it carries no content, and waking a
 *   terminated app would mean moving this entry point out of the isolated
 *   process.
 * - Everything else is delegated to the incumbent Expo delegate.
