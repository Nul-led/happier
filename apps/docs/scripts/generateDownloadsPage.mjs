/**
 * Renders the "Get the apps" page from the website's download manifest.
 *
 * Nothing on the documentation site told a reader where to get the app. Zero
 * hits for `apps.apple.com`, zero for the APK, zero for the desktop build — on
 * a 125-page site whose first section is called Getting started. Meanwhile
 * `apps/website/src/data/downloads.ts` already held every URL, was already the
 * single source of truth for the marketing site, and already had a link checker
 * (`yarn --cwd apps/website check:links`) HEADing all of them before deploy.
 *
 * So this page is generated from that file rather than retyped. The alternative
 * is two hand-maintained copies of the same URLs, which is how the website ended
 * up with three dead links in the first place — the exact history its own
 * docblock records.
 *
 * The page follows the manifest's current public routes: Google Play is the
 * primary Android listing, the direct APK remains available, and desktop
 * downloads use the rolling aliases published under the stable tag.

title: Get the apps
description: Where to download Happier for iPhone, Android, desktop and the browser, and which one to start with.
---

Happier runs your coding agents on a computer you control and gives you a way to
drive them from somewhere else. So you need two things: the CLI on the machine
that will do the work, and a client to drive it from.

Start with the client. You cannot finish the CLI's login without one — the
terminal prints a code for a browser or phone you are already signed in on.

## On your phone

<Cards>
  <Card title="iPhone and iPad" href="${m.appStore}" description="Happier on the App Store." />
  <Card title="Android" href="${m.androidPlay}" description="Happier on Google Play." />
</Cards>

If you prefer a direct installation without Google Play, download the current
[Android APK](${m.androidApk}).

## In a browser

[${m.webApp.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '').replace(/\/$/, '')}](${m.webApp}) is the
full client — no install, and the fastest way to see whether Happier suits you.
It is also the easiest place to complete the CLI login, because you are probably
already signed in to a browser on the machine you are setting up.

## On your desktop

The desktop app adds things a browser tab cannot do: it can install and manage
the background service for you, and it keeps a window and tray presence when the
session is running somewhere else.

| Platform | Download |
| --- | --- |
${desktopRows}

Every desktop build is listed on the [releases page](${m.desktopReleases}) if
you need an older one or a different architecture. The desktop app is
versioned separately from the CLI, so its number will not match
\`happier --version\`.

## On the machine that runs your agents

This is the part that does the work, and it is a CLI rather than an app:

\`\`\`bash
${m.installUnix}
\`\`\`

On Windows, in PowerShell:

\`\`\`powershell
${m.installWindows}
\`\`\`

The installer verifies every release signature before unpacking. See
[CLI](/apps/cli) for the other install routes, release channels, and what to
do when the command is not found afterwards.
