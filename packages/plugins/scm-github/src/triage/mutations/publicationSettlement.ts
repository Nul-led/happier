/**
 * Recording a publication with the canonical Reviews owner is an INTERNAL step, and
 * it happens after the external effect it describes already exists on GitHub.
 *
 * Letting that step's rejection propagate discards two things the user needs: the
 * publication result this invocation already proved by rereading the forge, and the
 * post-mutation exact `get` SCM 3.9.3 requires after every outcome that may have
 * changed provider state. Neither becomes less true because Happier's own server
 * could not be reached — and the comment is on a colleague's pull request either
 * way.
 *
 * So the failure is returned as a fact instead of thrown. Nothing is retried, no
 * receipt is written, and no uncertain entry is promoted: the canonical claim
 * remains outstanding at the server and a later rejoin settles it.
