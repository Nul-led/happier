/**
 * The clock a mounted surface evaluates the coordinator's refusal against.
 *
 * A pacing block is an absolute moment: the coordinator publishes
 * `nextEligibleAtMs`, and every surface that offers **Refresh** decides from it
 * whether a press may read right now. Reading `Date.now()` at render answers
 * that question correctly and answers it exactly once — so a page whose reader
 * simply waits out the deadline it was shown keeps a dead control and a notice
 * that has stopped being true. Nothing else was going to wake it: the window
 * store drops an expired refusal only when something reads its snapshot, and an
 * idle page reads nothing.
 *
 * So the moment the surface printed is the moment it observes. This is ONE
 * timeout for ONE already-published deadline, held only while a refusal is
 * actually displayed and cleared when it lifts or the surface unmounts. It
 * reads no provider, starts no pass, introduces no cadence and takes no
 * decision of its own: the deadline, the reason and the eligibility rule all
 * remain the coordinator's (`core/CORPUS.md` §4.2), and all this does is ask
 * the same owner again at the one moment its answer can have changed.
 *
 * It is deliberately not in the window store. A store-level wake would notify
 * every subscriber of a fact none of them may be showing, and the store's
 * own contract is that an elapsed refusal expires on READ — which is the right
 * rule for a projection and the wrong one for a control a person is looking at.
