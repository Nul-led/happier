/**
 * Reaching the end of the action a person is writing.
 *
 * The editor mounts inside the shell's clipped work region (`ui/shell/root.tsx`
 * gives the Screen, the fill row and the list region `overflow: hidden`), above
 * a list that owns its own virtualized scroll. The draft is a long sequence of
 * fields with **Save** and **Cancel** last, so on a short viewport, at a large
 * type size, or with a longer action catalog above it, the bottom of the form —
 * including the control that commits it — fell outside the clipped region with
 * no way to scroll to it. The work could be typed and not finished.
 *
 * The editor therefore owns ONE bounded scrolling region of its own. Its own,
 * because the list's virtualizer must keep the scroll it owns: a second
 * same-axis scroller wrapped around the list is the fix that breaks reveal,
 * measurement and keyboard paging for two thousand rows.
 *
 * Exact geometry at 375×667 and at the largest type size is a loaded-runtime
 * gate; what is asserted here is the structural fact that gate depends on —
 * that the form and its Save control are inside the editor's own scroll owner.
