/**
 * What a section's continuation row says, and whether it offers a press
 * (`core/SURFACE.md` §4.2).
 *
 * The row itself was written as a statement with no affordance, because at the
 * time there was nothing for it to invoke: **Refresh** re-read the same first
 * page at the same bound, so implying it could reach a further entry would have
 * made it a dead-end control. There is an operation now — the mount appends one
 * more bounded window, and the pinned section walks one more bounded page — and
 * this module is what turns the published state of that operation into the one
 * sentence and the at-most-one control the row carries.
 *
 * It is deliberately the whole mapping in one place. The two sections' states
 * come from different owners (the window store and the marks read) and their
 * copy differs, but "what is the reader told, and may they press it" is one
 * question; answering it at each row would let the pinned section and the lanes
 * drift into two vocabularies for the same five arms.
 *
 * Nothing here decides whether the row EXISTS. That stays with
 * `planTriageListSections`, which appends it exactly when the section is
 * unfinished — so `exhausted` cannot reach a rendered row, and the arm below is
 * an inert statement rather than a sixth kind of copy for a row that is absent.
