/**
 * The compact **Views** control (`core/SURFACE.md` §6.5).
 *
 * It names the lens the reader is looking through — a saved view by its own
 * name, or that same view as **Modified** once they have moved off it — and it
 * is where the five explicit operations live: select, create, rename, update
 * and delete.
 *
 * **One compact toolbar control.** The saved views and the four operations
 * live in the shared public `Dropdown`: a named radio group of views, then the
 * operations as menu actions. The roving focus, the checked semantics, the
 * dismissal and focus return are `plugin-ui`'s and the host's, reached through
 * props — there is no Triage popover, menu or focus handling in this file.
 * The trigger names the lens the reader is looking through, so the list page
 * reads as a work surface rather than a settings form.
 *
 * **It decides nothing durable.** `settings/savedViews.ts` mints the id,
 * validates every bound and owns the CAS verdict; `savedViewsCommand.ts` owns
 * what Rename and Update each save. The only bound named here is the view
 * count, imported from that owner so a Create control is not offered when the
 * next press could only be refused — the same reuse the reducer already makes
 * of the facet bound.
