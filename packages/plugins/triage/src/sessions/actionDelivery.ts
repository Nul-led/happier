/**
 * What happens to the resolved prompt once a Session exists (`PLAN.md` §0a A4a).
 *
 * `delivery` is the member that decides it, and until now it decided nothing:
 * every press produced a Session with an empty composer regardless of what the
 * action said. The two arms are genuinely different user actions:
 *
 *  - **`send`** — the reader asked for the work to start. The prompt is sent
 *    immediately, with no second confirmation, through the canonical Session
 *    input seam WITH the entry attached. The attachment is the point: a direct
 *    send that delivered a prompt and no entry context is the exact failure
 *    A4a exists to prevent, and the entry's authoritative facts are resolved at
 *    dispatch by the attachment's own `resolveForDispatch` rather than
 *    stringified into the text.
 *  - **`compose`** — the reader asked to look first. The same text and the same
 *    attachment are placed in the new Session's composer and nothing is sent,
 *    so they can edit, add, or abandon it.
 *
 * Both arms carry one attachment draft per valid entry, built by the one
 * composer-side owner (`composer/mutationPlan.ts#buildTriageEntryAttachmentDraftV1`),
 * so an entry attached by a direct send and an entry attached by the picker are
 * the same record.
 *
 * **The Prompt Library's own `behavior` does not decide this.**
 * `insert | insert_on_send | insert_and_send` is the affordance for somebody
 * typing that slash token into a composer; the action's `delivery` is what its
 * author configured here. The Library owns WHICH content resolves; the action
 * owns WHETHER it is composed or sent.
