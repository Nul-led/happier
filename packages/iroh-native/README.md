# @happier-dev/iroh-native

Optional native lifecycle substrate for the Iroh Home carrier. JavaScript,
Swift, and Kotlin expose lifecycle/status only; all stream bytes stay in Rust.
When unavailable, callers retain the existing HTTPS carrier.

The Rust core owns one shared process endpoint per endpoint identity (persistent
key path), explicit relay ownership (`automatic` with explicit descriptor relay
URLs → custom relay map; `disabled` → `RelayMode::Disabled`; never ambient n0
infrastructure), and the frozen cap profiles enforced at the QUIC transport
boundary. One handle-based JSON lifecycle exists on the native owner:
`createEndpoint`, `startHomeAcceptor`,
`ensureHomeTunnel`, `releaseHomeTunnel`, `stopHomeAcceptor`, `shutdownEndpoint`,
`getEndpointStatus`, and `getTunnelStatus`. Releasing one lease never shuts the
shared endpoint or sibling leases down; the application endpoint remains alive
until process/native lifecycle shutdown.

The Expo module links the shared `rust/happier-iroh-native` crate. Android builds
produce `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` JNI libraries through `scripts/build-rust-android.sh`;
iOS CocoaPods builds produce a static `HappierIrohNativeRust.xcframework` through
`scripts/build-rust-ios.sh`. The scripts require the matching Rust targets and
Android NDK/Xcode toolchains on the build host.

## Node/Bun lifecycle addon (server/desktop)

`@happier-dev/iroh-native/node` exposes the same JSON C ABI lifecycle owner to
Node and Bun. The thin NAPI crate `rust/happier-iroh-node` links the
`happier-iroh-native` rlib, so the exported `happier_iroh_native_*_json`
operations and `happier_iroh_native_free_string` run against the one
process-wide `OnceLock` runtime, `NativeRuntime`, `EndpointManager`, acceptor
set, and tunnel-lease map. The binding adds no runtime, no lifecycle logic,
and no payload APIs: requests and responses are validated JSON envelopes, and
tunnel bytes never cross.

```ts
import { loadIrohNodeNative } from '@happier-dev/iroh-native/node';

const loaded = loadIrohNodeNative(); // or loadIrohNodeNative(packageRoot) in packaged hosts
if (!loaded.available) {
  // typed { reason: 'native_unavailable', message } — never a guessed binary
} else {
  const endpoint = await loaded.native.createEndpoint({ keyPath, relayPolicy: 'automatic' });
  const acceptor = await loaded.native.startHomeAcceptor({ endpointHandle: endpoint.endpointHandle, targetPort });
  const lease = await loaded.native.ensureHomeTunnel({
    endpointHandle: endpoint.endpointHandle,
    homeServerIdentityId,
    endpointId: endpoint.endpointId,
    directAddresses,
  });
  await loaded.native.releaseHomeTunnel(lease.tunnelId);
  await loaded.native.shutdownEndpoint({ endpointHandle: endpoint.endpointHandle });
}
```

Artifact layout and resolution:

- one deterministic name per platform/arch:
  `native/happier-iroh-native-lifecycle.<platform>-<arch>.node`;
- supported targets: `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`,
  `win32-x64`; the build script targets the current host (Linux defaults to
  the gnu targets, pass `--musl` on musl hosts — one host has one libc);
- missing artifact, unsupported pair, or wrong surface ⇒ typed
  `native_unavailable` result; the loader never silently selects an
  unrelated binary;
- packaged hosts (Bun single-file server) pass the explicit `packageRoot`, or
  load one artifact directly with `loadIrohNodeNativeAddon(addonPath)`.

Build and verify on a host with a Rust toolchain:

```sh
node packages/iroh-native/scripts/build-node-addon.mjs        # cargo build + copy into native/
node packages/iroh-native/scripts/verify-node-addon-load.mjs  # Node load + lifecycle smoke
bun  packages/iroh-native/scripts/verify-node-addon-load.mjs  # same smoke under Bun
```

The addon exposes exactly the lifecycle operations listed in
`IROH_NODE_NATIVE_EXPORTS`;
`src/nodeNoPayloadCrossing.test.ts` enforces that surface against
typed-array/byte/payload/generic-dispatch APIs, and
`src/nodeNativeLifecycle.test.ts` proves shared-endpoint behavior through the
real binding when the artifact is built (skipped otherwise).

The forced-relay test fixture uses the pinned iroh local relay test facility and
is compiled only under the test-only `test-relay-fixture` cargo feature; it is
never a release behavior dependency. Build that separate host-only fixture with
`node packages/iroh-native/scripts/build-node-addon.mjs --test-relay-fixture`;
it writes a `native-test/happier-iroh-native-lifecycle-test.<platform>-<arch>.node` artifact
whose force/restore/observed-path operations are absent from the ordinary addon.
The fixture refuses topology changes while endpoints are active and drops its
local relay when `restoreAutomatic` succeeds.

## Real transport checks

Run the source-level native and browser journeys through their existing owners:

```sh
corepack yarn --cwd packages/iroh-native -s test:home-iroh:real
corepack yarn --cwd apps/ui -s proof:browser-iroh-real-verticals
```

The Docker relay journey uses the pinned stock relay image in
`deploy/iroh-relay/Dockerfile` and requires a running Docker engine:

```sh
corepack yarn --cwd packages/iroh-native -s test:home-iroh:docker
```

It verifies relayed file and attachment bytes against the stock containerized
relay, then exercises a fresh production Home and daemon as host test processes.
The same-host Home connection may take the direct path; its configuration alone
is not evidence of relay carriage. This does not simulate mobile network
transitions or arbitrary Internet NATs.
