 * The content-free closed-app wake this Home sends beside the badge refresh and

 *
 * It carries identifiers and an optional mute qualifier, never content. A
 * recipient device that receives it synchronizes that exact
 * Home and then evaluates the recipient's own Activity notification policy and
 * content builder locally, so the Home never has to learn the recipient's
 * settings to reach a closed app.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a delivery contract: Android delivers it as an ordinary
 * data message, iOS as a `content-available` background notification that the OS
 * may throttle, delay or discard. Repeated wakes are safe — synchronization is
 * idempotent and the local notification path dedupes on the canonical Activity
 * event identity.
