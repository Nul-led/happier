# Testing

This document records the repository-level test lane map and placement conventions. For workflow details, use the repo skill `.agents/skills/happier-testing` and the development guide at `apps/docs/content/docs/development/testing.mdx`.

## Top-level lanes

Canonical lanes:

- `yarn test` — fast unit lane across apps.
- `yarn test:import-cycles` — CLI runtime import-cycle guard, also enforced by the CLI unit lane.
- `yarn test:integration` — orchestration-heavy app integration lane.
- `yarn test:e2e:core:fast` — default local core e2e loop.
- `yarn test:e2e:core:slow` — long orchestration core e2e.
- `yarn test:e2e:ui` — Playwright UI/browser e2e exercising real UI + server + CLI/daemon flows.
- `yarn test:agents` — executable Agent runtime contracts; opt-in/flag-driven. The historical script name is retained for runner compatibility and does not refer to first-class model Providers.
- `yarn test:db-contract:docker` — server DB contract via Docker.
- `yarn test:plugin-platform:source` — current-source Plugin Platform owner contracts and public-only external-author/runtime fixtures. It never packs or installs an SDK, UI, CLI, or plugin archive.

Use the smallest relevant subset during RED/GREEN loops. Before handoff, run the touched package typecheck/build-enforcing lane and at least one broader relevant lane when shared contracts are touched.

## Choose checks by the changed contract

| Change | Focused loop | Integration boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package behavior | Existing owner test through real internal logic | Package typecheck and the affected unit/integration lane |
| Shared schema, catalog, or testkit | Shared owner tests plus an affected consumer | Relevant consumer lanes; producer-only green is insufficient |
| UI flow, layout mode, or selector | Relevant component test | Existing Playwright scenario with explicit viewport, mode, and permissions |
| Process, port, daemon, or session lifecycle | Existing process/testkit test | Owning integration lane; ephemeral ports and observed readiness, not fixed sleeps |
| CI selection, sharding, or root commands | Workflow/runner contracts and selected-file inventory | Prove complete, non-overlapping coverage and a failing final result when any required check fails |
| Installer, packaging, or release control | Canonical source contracts | Candidate-dependent smoke/update and publication checks after the actual artifact exists |

Use shared boundary fixtures and real internal owners. A changed internal export is not a reason to expand a local mock; inventory its callers and update the owning fixture once. Assert stable outcomes rather than old implementation spelling. Remove redundant or obsolete assertions only after identifying the behavior they formerly protected.

Root unit and integration commands collect failures across independent workspaces instead of stopping at the first red package. Package preparation remains a prerequisite; aggregate failure collection cannot expose behavior behind an unavailable build, database, or candidate. Do not call an unexecuted lane successful.

For broad local collection, inspect `node scripts/pipeline/run.mjs checks --profile fast --dry-run` first. For a focused rerun, use a workspace command or `checks --profile custom --custom-checks integration,typecheck --install-deps false`. Custom selection is exact, not an implicit full baseline. The checks owner collects independent failures and returns nonzero; install failure still stops dependent checks.

Local and hosted profiles share selection policy ownership in `scripts/pipeline/checks/lib/checks-profile.mjs`, but are not interchangeable matrices: local profiles preserve local toolchain coverage; hosted profiles include platform/runner jobs. Read the current command help or workflow inputs instead of assuming a local `fast` result certifies hosted `release` coverage. In 0.3, route these commands through `hstack-exec`; its public test scripts already do so.

In 0.3 development, a direct `hstack-exec` invocation from a configured Mac workspace delegates to its active primary execution host through the existing execution-host bridge. The authoritative host's native dispatcher then selects a worker using its own current configuration. Package working directories, launcher flags, explicit environment arguments and exit results survive that handoff. Explicit `--local`, already-placed children, CI and sandbox invocations retain their local paths; candidate profiles do not activate delegation.

Development command placement uses the native `apps/stack/bin/hstack-exec` owner, including POSIX commands launched through `dev-targets exec auto`. CPU load and used/available memory rank reachable targets; busy targets remain eligible and heavyweight work waits in the selected Linux machine's existing admission queue. That queue alone enforces the existing 6 GiB / 10% available-memory floor and CPU/memory pressure checks. The headroom derives from the audit's measured approximately 5.3 GB compiler and 1.1 GB suite footprints, rounded up together. Low-memory samples retain the default 15-second positive probe TTL. Dependency-refresh waiting belongs to the bootstrap's workspace lock beneath the same target admission. A selected sync-flush failure retries another target before any command starts; if reachable targets have synchronization or prerequisite failures, the launcher reports an actionable error. Configured `fallback=local` applies only when no remote target is reachable, with an explicit log. Explicit `includeLocal` participation, local placement and machine-local invocations remain distinct from fallback. Exit 137 remains authoritative and reports possible OOM with the last target memory sample; it is never automatically replayed. Windows command routing remains local. Outbound routing requires a cwd inside the synchronized repository; explicitly local publishers and already-placed children may use temporary repositories.

In 0.3 development, `apps/stack/scripts/utils/dev_targets/remote_commands.mjs` owns command classification; the native launcher consumes its generated `native_command_policy.sh` projection rather than maintaining another classifier. Native `node --test` commands receive installed-dependency readiness. Only source-proven test commands bypass workspace publication; unknown native commands retain component preparation. Stack dependency-closure publication is reserved for Stack validation, not every remote command. Default CLI/UI Vitest configurations resolve workspace source; default UI tests use the typed empty bundled-app inventory fixture, while `vitest.artifact-cache.config.ts` retains generated inventory and artifact preparation. Workspace build currentness remains owned by the dependency-closure/fingerprint path; there is no separate `prepare:build-inputs` hook.

CLI tests that copy or natively import physical public SDK packages run in `vitest.integration.config.ts`, through the same canonical workspace preparation. This includes public-authoring activation, cross-copy `PluginError`, lone-file SDK resolution, scaffold compiler/UI journeys and prepublication author installs and packs. Importing the live daemon catalog also consumes bundled publication metadata during collection; tests with that import graph use `*.runtimeCatalog.integration.test.ts`, while the catalog filesystem-boundary fixture stays source-owned. Source imports alone cannot satisfy copied-package, child-process or publication-metadata dependencies. The default configuration retains source-only cases and temporary filesystem/process fixtures that produce their own inputs.

Collect one complete reachable failure set, fix deterministic clusters locally, then rerun affected lanes. Use one final required hosted profile for the coherent source, not a full graph per test edit. Reuse successful evidence when source, dependencies, configuration, command, and environment remain applicable. New source or a previously unreachable candidate boundary can legitimately expose another failure.

Moving-source feature QA ends at source, integration, and the loaded development
runtime. A package tarball, candidate archive, or immutable release identity is
not an extra feature-completion gate. Exact-package consumer, integrity, and
publication checks run only inside an explicitly authorized release operation
against the bytes that operation may publish.

## Voice and audio validation

The current 0.3 development QA seam is [`createVoiceQaController`](../apps/ui/sources/voice/qa/voiceQaController.ts), with default dependencies in [`voiceQaRuntimeDeps.ts`](../apps/ui/sources/voice/qa/voiceQaRuntimeDeps.ts). Text and media start modes are distinct; media delegates to the normal Voice lifecycle owner and binds the exact Home-qualified Session target. [`voiceQaDebugRuntime.ts`](../apps/ui/sources/voice/qa/voiceQaDebugRuntime.ts) defines the development/debug-runtime check. This is a development validation aid, not a second Voice runtime or a release-availability claim.

Choose the evidence boundary before running a canary:

- Text injection tests turn/tool routing and textual results; it does not prove microphone capture, speech recognition, output audio or acoustic interruption.
- A media run must prove that input audio has energy and reaches the selected active transport. A live/enabled track or elapsed microphone time is insufficient. Measure the input and observe the expected transcript/result; capture output evidence separately when claiming audible behavior.
- Browser fixture capture can use Chromium's file-backed fake microphone when the browser supports it. Verify the loaded browser's actual track rather than assuming the launch flag worked. Simulator/emulator loopback tools are environment-specific aids, not substitutes for real device acoustics.
- Exercise permissions, cancellation, interruption, transport loss and terminal cleanup through the normal host owner. Record the actual runtime, platform, account and exact Session binding; a debug route or a text canary alone does not close the normal-UI journey.
- Physical microphone/speaker quality, AEC, Bluetooth routes, native audio focus and background/lock behavior need their named device/release checks. Missing hardware evidence is reported explicitly and does not manufacture another feature-completion gate.

An approved Voice program may require a larger composed journey; use its current execution recipe for that work. Standing evidence rules live here, while program status and past host measurements remain in the program's evidence.

## TypeScript toolchain

The repository deliberately separates the compiler from the programmatic TypeScript API:

- `@typescript/native` provides the TypeScript 7 compiler used by first-party typecheck and package-build lanes.
- `typescript` remains the TypeScript 5.9 API consumed by AST tooling and ecosystem integrations. Do not replace it with TypeScript 7 until the native release provides a stable compatible API and every consumer supports it.
- `scripts/workspaces/resolveTypeScriptCliInvocation.mjs` is the only compiler-selection owner. First-party scripts must use `runTypeScriptCli.mjs`, `buildTypeScriptPackageDist.mjs`, or that resolver directly; do not invoke a bare `tsc` shim or resolve `typescript/bin/tsc`.
- `yarn tsc ...` is defined at the repository root and in every TypeScript-owning workspace; it delegates to the shared native runner and therefore uses TypeScript 7.

## Lane naming and placement

- App integration tests: `*.integration.test.*`, `*.integration.spec.*`, `*.real.integration.test.*`.
- Core e2e slow tests: `packages/tests/suites/core-e2e/**/*.slow.e2e.test.ts`.
- Core e2e fast tests: other `packages/tests/suites/core-e2e/**/*.test.ts`.
- UI Playwright e2e: `packages/tests/suites/ui-e2e/**/*.spec.ts`.
- Agent runtime/stress suites remain under `packages/tests/suites/agents` and `packages/tests/suites/stress`.

First-class model Provider coverage follows its owning layer rather than the historical Agent-runner name:

- protocol schemas, settings, migrations, selection, compatibility, and catalog merge: `packages/protocol/src/providers/**/*.test.ts`;
- daemon resolution, probing, discovery, materialization, and lifecycle: `apps/cli/src/providers/**/*.test.ts`;
- Provider UI/settings/model-picker behavior: `apps/ui/sources/providers/**/*.test.ts(x)`;
- built-in Provider facts: `packages/plugins/<providerId>/src/provider/contribution.test.ts`;
- cross-package and real-session behavior: `packages/tests/suites/core-e2e/**` and `packages/tests/suites/ui-e2e/**` with `.feat.providers.` naming where feature gating applies.

Security-sensitive tests must prove fail-closed ordering: a disabled feature, invalid endpoint, absent machine grant, incompatible Agent binding, or missing connection must refuse before secret lookup, network I/O, or process spawn.

Treat `test` and `test:unit` as fast lanes. Put Dockerized dependencies, multiprocess setups, external services, real network calls, or other heavy orchestration into integration/e2e/provider lanes.

When introducing or moving a lane/pattern, update all relevant places in the same change:

1. package-level scripts/config,
2. root `package.json` lane scripts,
3. CI workflow wiring.

## UI e2e authoring

- Prefer stable React Native `testID` selectors, queried in Playwright with `getByTestId(...)`.
- Treat e2e `testID`s as API surface; update specs when renaming/removing them.
- Wait for controls to be enabled before clicking.
- Click the real submit/confirm affordance.
- Do not rely on settings-sensitive shortcuts such as Enter-to-send unless the test explicitly configures that setting.
- UI e2e artifacts live under `packages/tests/.project/logs/e2e/ui-playwright/`.
- UI e2e runtime process logs live under `.project/logs/e2e/*ui-e2e*/`.

## Guardrails

- No `.skip`, `.todo`, `.only`, or hidden conditional skips in committed tests unless an explicit opt-in external probe documents the gate.
- No debugging logs in tests.
- No duplicate test intent.
- Evidence must come from trusted runners, not fabricated/manual output.
- Prefer contract-focused assertions over copy/formatting assertions.
- CLI runtime import cycles are fail-closed: update the baseline only for known debt, and keep `yarn test:import-cycles` wired through the root script and `@happier-dev/cli` unit lane so CI exercises it with CLI tests.
